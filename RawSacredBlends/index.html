          <h2>What Is Hapé?</h2>
          <p>
            Hapé (also spelled rapé) is a sacred, finely ground herbal blend traditionally prepared and shared by various Indigenous communities across South America. While recipes vary by lineage, hapé commonly includes tobacco (such as Mapacho) combined with forest botanicals and ashes, and is offered in ritual contexts to support grounding, clarity, prayer, and connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            At RawSacredBlends, we honor the cultural roots of hapé by emphasizing respectful sourcing, ceremonial intention, and responsible use. Our blends are crafted for ritual practice, meditation, and offerings—never as recreational or medical products.
